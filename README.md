# MPVConfig

Personal MPV Configuration, the goal is to increase video quality to the fucking tits.
This should be the most high quality video could get on mpv as far as I know; if you know of better settings please let me know.

# Changes
- Everything is upscaled and stuff, to a reasonable amount (no need to upscale if the video is already 4k for instance)
  - FSRCNNX for luma
  - KrigBilateral for chroma
  
- Video interpolation; requires vapoursync and python embedded into the mpv installation folder along MVTools library
  - [Portable Vapoursynth](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/releases)
  - [Embedded Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
  - [MVTools](https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-mvtools/releases)
